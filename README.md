# TALQS â€“ Transformer-based Architecture for Legal Question Answering and Summarization

## ðŸ“– Project Explanation

TALQS is an AI-powered platform designed to simplify the understanding of complex legal documents.  
The goal of the project is to make legal information more accessible by providing two core features:

1. **Legal Document Summarization**  
   - Users can upload lengthy legal judgments or case files in PDF or text format.  
   - The system uses a Transformer-based model to generate concise, meaningful summaries.  
   - This helps readers quickly grasp the key points without going through the entire document.  

2. **Legal Question Answering (Q&A)**  
   - Users can ask domain-specific questions related to the uploaded legal text.  
   - The AI model retrieves relevant portions and provides accurate answers.  
   - This feature helps in legal research, academic study, and professional practice.  

The platform also includes **user authentication** and a **history section** where summaries and Q&A sessions are saved for later reference.  
History is categorized into two sections: **Summaries** and **Questions & Answers**, allowing users to track their interactions with the system.  

By combining **NLP, AI, and web technologies**, TALQS bridges the gap between complex legal literature and accessible knowledge, making it useful for law students, researchers, professionals, and the general public.
